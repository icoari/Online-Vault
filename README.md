# 🚀 Password Manager - A Secure & Efficient Vault  

> **🛠️ Project 02 - Online Vault Password Manager** is part of a personal learning journey to hone my **JavaScript**, skills and dive deeper into **frontend security**, **UI/UX**, and **encryption best practices**. Building this Password Manager helps me strengthen my understanding of cryptography, secure data storage, and user-centric interfaces. 🛡️

**Password Manager** is a web application designed to help you **securely store, manage, and generate strong passwords**. It utilizes robust encryption, supports multiple categories, generates TOTP codes, and offers an intuitive interface to keep your credentials safe yet easily accessible. 🔑

### 🌟 Features  
- **AES-GCM Encryption** – Your vault is protected locally with a derived key (PBKDF2 + Salt).  
- **Master Password** – One strong passphrase to unlock all your credentials.  
- **TOTP (2FA) Support** – Built-in One-Time Password (TOTP) generation for extra security.  
- **Categories & Color-Coding** – Easily organize entries by custom categories.  
- **Drag & Drop** – Move entries around or reorder categories intuitively.  
- **Vault Analysis** – Check for reused or weak passwords, and see if they’re compromised (HaveIBeenPwned API).  
- **Export/Import** – Securely back up or restore your vault as an encrypted `.html` file.  
- **Auto-Lock & Timeout** – Automatically locks after inactivity to protect your data.  
- **Multi-Language UI** – (French, English, Spanish, German) with theming options.  
- **Offline-Ready** – All encryption and data handling occur locally in your browser.  

**Bonus**  
✔️ Modern, interactive UI with smooth transitions.  
✔️ **Dark/Light/Retro** themes.
